        <h1 align=center>About me</h1>
        <div class="bio">
        <p> 
            
            I'm Aabir Sarkar from Navrachna International School. 
            Mainly a tech enthusiast and avid reader I like to code and love essentially anything that has to do with software.
           
           
            I also love being creative. With creativity, even a wreck can be turned out to be a valuable thing.
            
           
            I being a millennial know that Teenagers as the country's future leaders should have a mindset to pursue their idea. There is a quote that says, dream big and keep on dreaming big. 
            
            Perhaps my best quality is patience. Many young students fail to accomplish their dream because they can't handle the pressure. They become frustrated and devastated due to unsatisfying outcomes, such as less marks, no success and more. The only way to cure it is to be patient and optimistic, for there will be a break-even point and followed by success. 
            My passion moreover is to one day become the CTO of a successful Tech Giant.
